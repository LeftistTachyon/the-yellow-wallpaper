					<p>The narrator is sentenced to a rest cure, which was being "voluntarily" (in the loosest sense of the word) confined to a bed to try to treat a disease. This is likely because of her becoming "unreasonably angry with" her husband at times, since it was widely accepted at that time as a cure for unruly behavior.</p>
					<p>At the beginning of the story, the narrator is very reasonable, taking offence from the unusual wallpaper and its "flamboyant patterns". She even goes to far as to say they "[commit] every artistic sin."</p>

				<td colspan="2" class="expand-content" style="display:none;" id="two">
					<p>As the narrator becomes more aquainted with the room, she includes more details about her surroundings, which means that she has taken a certain interest in it. She has even started personifying it, with a pattern of "a broken neck and two bulbous eyes". Also, she starts doubting her husband's judgement, even going so far as to confront him about it, asking him to "take me away." He declined, as it was his idea from the start.</p>

					<p>After lying in bed for so long, the narrator starts going insane. She first sees a "faint figure behind" the wallpaper seemingly "[shaking] the pattern", which can be considered a visual hallucination. Afterward, she sees "bars" and "a women behind it". Her obsession with the wallpaper only grows with her stay in the room, as she starts "flourishing" purely "<i>because</i> of the wall-paper". She even associates a "subtlest, most enduring odor" of the wallpaper in "damp weather" as "[a] yellow smell." Her mind is undoubtedly occupied with the wallpaper for the entire day, and her obsession is only exacerbating her mental instability.</p>

				<td colspan="2" class="expand-content" style="display:none;" id="four">
					<p>In the last few pages, the narrator loses it, and her reality blurs with fantasy. She continues to see the pattern moving because a "woman behind shakes it," and her descriptions of the wallpaper only become more fantastical. The narrator even sees the woman from the wallpaper "[get] out in the daytime", which later leads the narrator to wonder if she is alike her in being trapped in the wallpaper. In the end, she proclaims that she has "pulled off most of the paper" so John and Jane "can't put [her] back". At this point, she is completely delusional and has devolved from her previously stable state to this.</p>
